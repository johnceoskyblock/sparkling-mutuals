# Sparkling mode update

- Added `/sparkle` and a Modes settings tab for Unique, Full Clear and Sparkling runs.
- Sparkling mode checks every party member’s missing sparkling discoveries, including your own, and highlights the combined list for the whole run.
- Added a separate “Critter ESP for profitable shards” setting for Sparkling mode.
- Party lookups run in the background with shared caching. API errors stay local; incomplete lookups never mark discoveries as complete for the party.
- Forest floor drops hide when everyone has all three sparkling birds.
- Cavern floor drops hide when everyone has sparkling Gemzie, when Gemzie has been caught, or when all gems have been found.
- Haunted floor drops stay visible while anyone still needs sparkling Gimmiegold. Otherwise they hide after four Soothing Incense or a Doomspiral capture, including incense found at the start of the run.
- Icy floor drops remain hidden in Unique mode and hide after two Icebreakers in Full Clear and Sparkling modes.
- Cavern and Icy manual floor-drop overrides remain available until you leave the biome.
- Updated command help and README. Builds are available from GitHub Actions.
