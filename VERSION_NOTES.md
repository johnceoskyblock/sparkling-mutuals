# Sparkling modes and Safari helpers update

- Added `/sparkle` and a Modes settings tab for Unique, Full Clear and Sparkling runs.
- Sparkling mode checks every party member’s missing sparkling discoveries, including your own, and highlights the combined list for the whole run.
- Added a separate “Critter ESP for profitable shards” setting for Sparkling mode.
- Party lookups run in the background with shared caching. API errors stay local; incomplete lookups never mark discoveries as complete for the party.
- Forest floor drops hide when everyone has all three sparkling birds.
- Cavern floor drops hide when everyone has sparkling Gemzie, when Gemzie has been caught, or when all gems have been found.
- Haunted floor drops stay visible while anyone still needs sparkling Gimmiegold. Otherwise they hide after four Soothing Incense or a Doomspiral capture, including incense found at the start of the run.
- Icy floor drops remain hidden in Unique mode and hide after two Icebreakers in Full Clear and Sparkling modes.
- Cavern and Icy manual floor-drop overrides remain available until you leave the biome.
- Full Clear returns biome PBs and all-species sparkling lookups. Unique returns unique-biome and Doomspiral/Wumpa PBs with timesave lookups. Sparkling returns Doomspiral/Wumpa PBs only, also with timesave lookups.
- Auto Clicker now requires physically holding Mouse 0 on a Rockmite mound, stopping immediately on release or target changes.
- Added a Full candle hitbox setting in Safari Helpers, making Haunted candles easier to click while holding Soothing Incense.
- Party help lists actual commands available in your mode. Local command help, settings descriptions and chat feedback are shorter and clearer.
- Warp reminder settings now describe their purpose: warping party leechers in before entry closes.
- Updated README. Builds are available from GitHub Actions.
